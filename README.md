# NU Demo Day Project
Over the past 3 months, I participated in a Full-Stack Web Development cohort at Northwestern University. During the last three weeks of this program, I was tasked with creating a Full-Stack Website as my final project to be presented at Demo Day. When developing websites, I prefer using no outside frameworks or libraries for the design of my clients' web pages. I strictly code Vanilla CSS using flexbox and CSS grid for the layout of my user interface. I design sites this way so I have the ability to create web pages that are different from the current flow of the internet. Computer Software Programs such as Adobe After Effects, Photoshop and Blender give developers more room for customizing websites to each customer's needs.
